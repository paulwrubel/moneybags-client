# Solid Budget

## Preamble

This project is a local-only, `localstorage`-based budgeting [Single-page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application), designed to self-hosted and completely offline.

The project is using, built on top of, or sourcing resources from the following projects and technologies:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Drone](https://www.drone.io/)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). All scripts that ship with this framework are available here as well. Additionally, a Makefile is provided to ease the initialization even further.

## Getting Started

After cloning this repo, you can simply run `make run` or simply `make` to start up the development build. 

Linting is also available through [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) bindings by running `make pretty`. This is a non-destructive action that prints linting issue to the terminal.
